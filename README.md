This repository demonstrates a common integer overflow bug in Solidity and its solution.  The `bug.sol` file contains the buggy code, which is susceptible to integer overflow when adding large numbers. The `bugSolution.sol` file shows a corrected version using SafeMath library.  The bug is a silent failure, returning a seemingly correct but incorrect result.  Understanding how to prevent integer overflow is critical for developing secure smart contracts.
